# Train-Schedule
### Track your next destination

* Used Firebase to host arrival and departure data for trains.

* My app retrieves and manipulates time information using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

* When adding trains, administrators are able to submit:

    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
    
    * This app calculates when the next train will arrive, relative to current time
    
    * Users from many different machines are able to view these same train times
